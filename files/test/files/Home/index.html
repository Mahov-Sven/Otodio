			In order to create a test page of your own, you will have to follow
			the following steps.
			<ol class="List">
				<li>Fork the repository on GitHub, or if you are a member of
					the team, clone the repository.
				<li>Once forked, add a directory with the title of your test
					page at 'files/test/files/[PAGE_TITLE]'
				<li>Within that directory add an 'index.html' file, a
					'script.js' file, and a 'style.css' file
				<li>In the 'Main.js' file located at
					'files/test/scripts/Main.js' add the following line after the last
					one like it: 'Main_createTab("[PAGE_TITLE]",
					"files/[PAGE_TITLE]");'
			</ol>
			<div class="Spacer"></div>
			Your tab should now be setup and will show on the test page at
			'localhost/files/test/'. In order to make changes to your website you
			can edit the following files:
			<ul class="List">
				<li>index.html: holds the test HTML content for whatever you're
					working on. It is injected into the page after the HTML.
				<li>style.css: holds the test CSS content for whatever you're
					working on. It is injected into the page directly after the HTML.
				<li>script.js: holds the test JavaScript content for whatever
					you're working on. It is injected into the page (and not cleaned)
					directly after the style.css.
			</ul>
			<div class="Spacer"></div>
			Even though the connection between them is not directly evident (you
			don't actually add the script tags to your HTML file to put it in),
			it might seem a little difficult to understand, but know that under
			the hood, there is already a system put in place to get your HTML,
			CSS and JavaScript files when you open your tab and then inject them
			separately, but in order. Additionally, since none of these files are
			cleaned, please make sure that you do not put any malicious JS code
			into yoru file. Any malicious JS code found will not be allowed to be
			merged into the main branch anyway.
