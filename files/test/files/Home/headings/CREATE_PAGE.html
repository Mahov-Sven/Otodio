<div class="Text">
	In order to create a test page of your own, you will have to follow the
	following steps:
	<ol class="List">
		<li class="ListElement">Fork the repository on GitHub, or if you
			are a member of the team, clone the repository.
		<li class="ListElement">Once forked, add a directory with the
			title of your test page at
			<div class="String">files/test/files/[PAGE_TITLE]</div>
		<li class="ListElement">Within that directory add an
			<div class="String">index.html</div> file, a
			<div class="String">script.js</div> file, and a
			<div class="String">style.css</div> file
		<li class="ListElement">In the
			<div class="String">fragments.txt</div> file located at
			<div class="String">files/test/files/fragments.txt</div> add a line,
			alphabetically, after the first line which is
			<div class="String">Home</div> with the name of your
			<div class="String">[PAGE_TITLE]</div>
		<li class="ListElement">You may now add or remove other tabs from
			showing on the test page by adding a
			<div class="String">//</div> at the beginning
		<li class="ListElement">When you commit, comment out all lines
			except
			<div class="String">Home</div> or other lines which were not already
			commented out. The commit changes should show only a change on the
			new line you added
	</ol>
	<div class="Spacer"></div>
	Your tab should now be setup and will show on the test page at
	<div class="String">localhost/files/test/</div>
	. In order to make changes to your website you can edit the following
	files:
	<ul class="List">
		<li class="ListElement"><div class="String">style.css</div>:
			holds the test CSS content for whatever you're working on.
		<li class="ListElement"><div class="String">index.html</div>:
			holds the test HTML content for whatever you're working on. It is
			injected into the page directly after the CSS.
		<li class="ListElement"><div class="String">script.js</div>:
			holds the test JavaScript content for whatever you're working on. It
			is injected into the page (and not cleaned) directly after the
			style.css.
	</ul>
	<div class="Spacer"></div>
	Even though the connection between them is not directly evident (you
	don't actually add the script tags to your HTML file to put your JS
	file in), but know under the hood, there is already a system put in
	place to retrieve your HTML, CSS and JavaScript files when you open
	your tab and then inject them into this page's content. Since none of
	these files are cleaned, please make sure that you do not put any
	malicious JS code into your file. Any malicious JS code found will not
	be allowed to be merged into the main branch anyway.
