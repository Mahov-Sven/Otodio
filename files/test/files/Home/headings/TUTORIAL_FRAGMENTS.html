	The first thing to understanding HTML Fragments, or rather fragments in
	general, is understanding what a fragment is in the first place. A
	fragment is a piece of text that is either interpreted or injected
	directly into a "Macro" file: a file that will contain the content of
	the fragment. In this case, we use the second strategy in order to take
	advantage of HTML being a text-based language. <br> <br> To
	start, it is worth looking into how HTML injection through JavaScript
	works.
	<div class="Code">
		const elem = document.getElementById([HTML_ELEMENT_ID]); <br>
		console.log(elem.innerHTML);
	</div>
	The above line of JavaScript will print out the contents of the element
	with the given id. The contents that are printed out will always be in
	HTML, not as some object. Not only can you print the contents of an
	element, but you can also set the contents of an element through this
	method.
	<div class="Code">
		const elem = document.getElementById([HTML_ELEMENT_ID]); <br>
		elem.innerHTML = `&ltdiv class="foo" id="bar"&gtHello
		World&lt/div&gt`;
	</div>
	The above line will set the HTML content of the element with the given
	id. Note, it <strong><em>sets</em></strong> the content, it does not append. If
	you put this line of code into your JS file or use it on the console,
	you'll notice that a new element will appear with the text
	<div class="String">Hello World</div>
	in it. This is what is called HTML injection. From here, you can guess
	that all matter of HTML can be injected this way; you can inject
	tables, forms, CSS stylesheets, and even JavaScript. Using this
	functionality, the
	<div class="String">Loader.js</div>
	file located at
	<div class="String">files/scripts/Loader.js</div>
	provides a method to insert HTML directly after the last child element
	instead of just deleting all other children. You can use it by coding:
	<div class="Code">Loader.loadIntoPage([HTML_ELEMENT_ID],
		[HTML_TO_INJECT]);</div>
	While this goes a long way into putting HTML into your page from your
	JavaScript, sometimes you want a file to be loaded so you don't have to
	edit the JS file everytime. This is the true form of a fragment. This
	can be done easily through the
	<div class="String">Loader.js</div>
	file as mentioned above. The method provdided to load a file is
	<div class="Code">Loader.loadFile([FILE_LOCATION],
		[CALLBACK_FUNCTION])</div>
	The
	<div class="String">FILE_LOCATION</div>
	is the path to the file starting from where the current JavaScript will
	be executed (not necessarily where the JS file actually is) and
	includes both the file and file type at the end of the path.
	<div class="String">CALLBACK_FUNCTION</div>
	is a function which will be called when the file contents have been
	retrieved. The function takes in a single argument, which is the
	content of the file given.
