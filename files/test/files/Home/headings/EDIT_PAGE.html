<div class="Text">
	Editing your page is easy and fairly hands off! You only need to edit
	the
	<div class="String">index.html</div>
	,
	<div class="String">style.css</div>
	and your
	<div class="String">script.js</div>
	files, and their content will be automatically loaded when you open
	your tab.
	<div class="Spacer"></div>

	<strong>index.html</strong>
	<div class="Line"></div>
	Your
	<div class="String">index.html</div>
	includes the HTML for your page. The HTML you write should <strong><em>not</em></strong>
	start with HTML tags such as
	<div class="String">html</div>
	,
	<div class="String">head</div>
	,
	<div class="String">title</div>
	,
	<div class="String">body</div>
	, etc. All of these tags should be used only by the parent page, not
	your fragment. Your HTML may include tags like
	<div class="String">a</div>
	,
	<div class="String">style</div>
	and
	<div class="String">script</div>
	, but note that any links or paths to files you provide will need to be
	changed a little as noted below in <strong>Additional
		Information</strong>. As a tip, using the
	<div class="String">div</div>
	tag as a container, as if it was the
	<div class="String">body</div>
	tag of an HTML file works quite well.
	<div class="Spacer"></div>

	<strong>style.css</strong>
	<div class="Line"></div>
	Your
	<div class="String">style.css</div>
	file includes the CSS for your page. While there are some restrictions
	to it as noted below in <strong>Additional Information</strong>, you
	probably won't have problems so do not worry about how or what you name
	your CSS classes and IDs.
	<div class="Spacer"></div>

	<strong>script.js</strong>
	<div class="Line"></div>
	Your
	<div class="String">script.js</div>
	file includes the JavaScript for your page. While there are some
	restrictions to your function names as noted below in <strong>Additional
		Information</strong>, you probably won't have problems with it. Additionally,
	the
	<div class="Code">fragmentReady()</div>
	function is called when the script is loaded. It can be used in the
	following example:
	<div class="Code">
		/* Global JavaScript */<br> /* ... */<br> <br>/* Called
		On Script Load */<br> fragmentReady(){<br> &emsp;/* Local
		JavaScript */<br>&emsp;/* ... */<br>}<br> /* Global
		JavaScript */<br> /* ... */<br>
	</div>
	<div class="Spacer"></div>

	<strong>Additional Information</strong>
	<div class="Line"></div>
	While the above information is fine for starting with the files, there
	is some additional information you should know.
	<ol class="List">
		<li class="ListElement">All Paths specified for files do <strong><em>not</em></strong>
			start from the directory of your
			<div class="String">index.html</div> file, but instead originates
			from the
			<div class="String">index.html</div> of the parent file, that is,
			from
			<div class="String">files/test/</div>. This is the base directory. If
			you want to access a file in your tab in a subdirectory you would
			write the path as:
			<div class="String">files/[PAGE_TITLE]/[PATH]</div> where the
			<div class="String">[PATH]</div> is the path the the file from your
			fragment's directory. For example, your fragment's
			<div class="String">script.js</div> file has a simple
			<div class="String">[PATH]</div> of
			<div class="String">script.js</div>
		<li class="ListElement">You should <strong><em>not</em></strong>
			name any of your IDs in HTML starting with
			<div class="String">TEST_PAGE</div>. This ID keyword is reserved for
			the parent page to use. All other ID names are fine.
		<li class="ListElement">You should <strong><em>not</em></strong>
			name any of your JavaScript functions starting with
			<div class="String">Main</div>. This keyword is reserved for all
			functions in
			<div class="String">Main.js</div> which contains the JavaScript
			functions for the parent page.
		<li class="ListElement">You should <strong><em>not</em></strong>
			name any of your CSS styling for IDs starting with
			<div class="String">TEST_PAGE</div> as this is reserved as explained
			above. Nor should you name any of your CSS classes starting with
			<div class="String">TestPage</div> as this is also reserved for the
			parent page's CSS classes.
